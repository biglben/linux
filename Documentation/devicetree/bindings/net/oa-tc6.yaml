description:
  These are generic properties that can apply to any 10BASE-T1x MAC-PHY
  which uses OPEN Alliance TC6 specification.

  10BASE-T1x MAC-PHY Serial Interface Specification can be found at:
    https://opensig.org/about/specifications/

    pattern: "^oa-tc6(@.*)?"

  "#address-cells":
    const: 1

  "#size-cells":
    const: 0

  oa-cps:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Chunk Payload Size. Configures the data chunk payload size to 2^N,
      where N is the value of this bitfield. The minimum possible data
      chunk payload size is 8 bytes or N = 3. The default data chunk
      payload size is 64 bytes, or N = 6. The minimum supported data chunk
      payload size for this MAC-PHY device is indicated in the CPSMIN
      field of the CAPABILITY register. Valid values for this parameter
      are 8, 16, 32 and 64. All other values are reserved.

  oa-txcte:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Transmit Cut-Through Enable. When supported by this MAC-PHY device,
      this bit enables the cut-through mode of frame transfer through the
      MAC-PHY device from the SPI host to the network.

  oa-rxcte:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Receive Cut-Through Enable. When supported by this MAC-PHY device,
      this bit enables the cut-through mode of frame transfer through the
      MAC-PHY device from the network to the SPI host.

  oa-prote:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Control data read/write Protection Enable. When set, all control
      data written to and read from the MAC-PHY will be transferred with
      its complement for detection of bit errors.

  oa-dprac:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Direct PHY Register Access Capability. Indicates if PHY registers
      are directly accessible within the SPI register memory space.

  oa-dprac:
    maxItems: 1
    description:
      Indirect PHY Register Access Capability. Indicates if PHY registers
      are indirectly accessible through the MDIO/MDC registers MDIOACCn.
